Hi, I’m @Newbie827
I’m interested to find out if im smart enough to learn the technics of python programming
 I’m currently finding out how to make a better life from learning from people who could show me that i have more knowledge then i knew i had 
 I’m looking to collaborate with people who have gone down the wrong path but really shown people are capable then alot more then they think 
reach out on here
Fun fact tonight has been a eventful weird but probaly the most understanding thing in my live and was shown by some nice people who have been in rough situations but never gave up and gave the most mind changing experience showing me i was alot more smarter than i was and really wjen you hit rock bottom its not really rock bottom there are amazing people in this world id never thought id speak with but jsut know his changed how i see life nd theres so much more potential.
